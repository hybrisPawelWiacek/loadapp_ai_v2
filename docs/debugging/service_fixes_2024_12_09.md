# Service Fixes - December 9, 2024

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Operation Parameter in Performance Metrics Decorator
**Location:** `backend/domain/services/cost_calculation_service.py`
**Issue:** The `@measure_service_operation_time` decorator was missing required parameters.
**Fix:** Added proper parameters to the decorator:
```python
@measure_service_operation_time(
    service="CostCalculationService",
    operation="calculate_route_cost"
)
```

### 2. ValidationResult Import Error
**Location:** `backend/domain/services/cost_settings_service.py`
**Issue:** Importing non-existent `ValidationResult` class from cost setting validator.
**Fix:** Updated import to use the correct `ValidationError` class:
```python
from ..validators.cost_setting_validator import CostSettingValidator, ValidationError
```

### 3. OptimizationService Dependency
**Location:** `backend/domain/services/cost_calculation_service.py`
**Issue:** Dependency on non-existent generic `OptimizationService`.
**Fix:** 
- Removed dependency on generic `OptimizationService`
- Using `CostOptimizationService` directly for cost-specific optimizations
- Updated service initialization and method calls accordingly

## Impact
These fixes resolved several startup and runtime errors:
1. Application can now start without the performance metrics decorator error
2. Cost settings validation works correctly with proper error handling
3. Cost calculation and optimization are properly integrated

## Related Documentation Updates
- Updated SERVICES.md with detailed documentation of CostCalculationService
- Added documentation for CostOptimizationService
- Updated service integration details

## Future Considerations
1. Consider implementing a generic optimization interface if needed for future optimization features
2. Monitor performance metrics to ensure they're being collected correctly
3. Consider adding more specific validation error types if needed
