# LoadApp.AI Project Scope

## Overview

LoadApp.AI is a proof-of-concept (POC) application designed to streamline logistics operations through intelligent route planning and cost calculation.

## Core Features

### Route Planning
- Calculate optimal routes between pickup and delivery points
- Handle empty driving scenarios
- Validate route feasibility
- Integrate with mapping services (mocked in POC)

### Cost Calculation
- Aggregate multiple cost factors:
  - Fuel consumption
  - Toll charges
  - Driver wages
  - Empty driving costs
  - Cargo-specific handling
- Provide transparent cost breakdown
- Support cost factor customization

### Offer Generation
- Calculate final pricing with configurable margins
- Generate comprehensive offer documents
- Store offer history
- Enhance offers with AI-generated content

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Domain-driven design principles
- Clean architecture patterns
- Maintainable and testable codebase

### Performance
- Quick response times for route calculations
- Efficient cost computations
- Optimized database queries

### Scalability
- Support for future feature additions
- Extensible cost calculation system
- Flexible offer generation pipeline

### Security
- Basic authentication system (not implemented in POC)
- Data validation and sanitization
- Error handling and logging

## Future Considerations

### Real-time Integration
- Live traffic data
- Dynamic route optimization
- Real-time cost updates

### Advanced Features
- Multi-stop route planning
- Complex pricing models
- Historical data analysis
- AI-driven decision support

### Infrastructure
- Production-grade database
- Load balancing
- Monitoring and alerting
- Automated deployments
